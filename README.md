Decision Tree Classifier

Decision Tree Classifiers work by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features. These rules can be used to predict the value of the target variable for new data sample.

It is a tree like structure where each internal node represents a feature, each branch represents a decision rule and each leaf node represents a prediction.

Decision Tree Algorithm works by recursively splitting the data into smaller and smaller subsets based on the feature values. At each node the algorithm chooses the feature that best splits the data into groups with different target values.
